			<p1 class="about-me-text"> Hello! Thanks for being so kind and stopping by to have ~virtual~ tea with me! </p1> <br><br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> In case you&rsquo;ve missed the gigantic banner in the home page, my name is Ashley. I am currently majoring in computer science and minoring in cinematic arts at the University of Southern California. </p1> <br><br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> As a programmer with an interest in design, I love to emphasize on user interface when building products. </p1> <br><br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> I have a curious mind, so I don&rsquo;t want to limit myself to just what is taught in the classroom but also explore beyond the field of my study. In my free time, I go on Youtube or LinkedIn Learning to learn some new skills. I believe self-learning is essential as it improves my critical thinking and patience when I have to troubleshoot problems on my own, and in the process, I acquire more skills under my belt! </p1> <br><br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> Through online tutorials and my own experimenting, I have learned how to edit videos on Premiere Pro, create animations on Adobe Animate and After Effects, and create graphics on Adobe Photoshop. Currently, I&rsquo;m in the progress of learning how to crochet and code in C# for Unity. </p1> <br><br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> With my experiences in the variety of Adobe softwares, I was hired as a summer instructor at iD Tech to teach animation and video editing. In addition, I also taught college-level C++ courses and Javascript/CSS/HTML course, both with an emphasis in gaming and creating graphics. Due to the ongoing pandemic, I taught the courses through Zoom and was able to teach students from different states as well as students living around the globe. During my time as an instructor, I strived to inspire students to learn beyond the given curriculum by creating my own lesson plans to meet my students&rsquo; interests. </p1> <br><br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> To view my projects, experiences, and art, click through the navigation bar on the left. Choose from the &ldquo;assortment&rdquo; of teabags below to connect with me or contact me. I hope you enjoy your time here (on my website)! </p1><br><br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> Cheers,</p1> <br>
			<p1 class="about-me-text"> Ashley </p1>
